# JavaScript MCP Server Test Checklist

## Pre-Testing Tasks
- [x] Ensure server is built (`npm run build`)
- [x] Check that Claude Desktop is running
- [x] Verify server status is connected in Claude Desktop
- [x] Prepare a scratch document for recording results

## Status Tool
- [x] Test basic status check (`js-status`)

## JavaScript Execution Tool
- [x] Test basic arithmetic (`js-execute`)
- [x] Test console output capture
- [x] Test complex data structures
- [x] Test asynchronous code execution with promises
- [x] Test error handling
- [x] Test execution timeout functionality
- [x] Test return value formatting for different types

## REPL Session Management Tools
- [x] Test session creation (`js-createSession`)
- [x] Test session execution (`js-executeInSession`)
- [x] Test variable persistence across executions
- [x] Test listing sessions (`js-listSessions`)
- [x] Test getting session info (`js-sessionInfo`)
- [x] Test deleting a session (`js-deleteSession`)
- [x] Test behavior with invalid sessions

## NPM Package Management Tools
- [x] Test finding non-installed packages (`js-findPackage`)
- [x] Test package installation (`js-installPackage`)
- [x] Test finding installed packages
- [x] Test using installed packages in execution

## TypeScript Tools
- [x] Test basic TypeScript transpilation (`js-transpile`)
- [x] Test transpilation with type checking
- [x] Test source map generation
- [x] Test handling of TypeScript errors
- [x] Test direct TypeScript execution (`js-executeTypeScript`)
- [x] Test class and interface transpilation

## Error Handling
- [x] Test behavior with syntax errors
- [x] Test behavior with runtime errors
- [x] Test behavior with type errors
- [x] Test behavior with timeouts
- [x] Test behavior with non-existent resources

## Advanced Testing
- [-] Test complex session workflows (defining classes, using methods) - skipped due to syntax issues
- [-] Test advanced async patterns (async/await, promise chains) - skipped due to syntax issues
- [-] Test interoperability between tools (install package â†’ use in session) - skipped due to syntax issues

## Post-Testing Tasks
- [x] Compile all test results
- [x] Document any issues found
- [x] Identify areas for improvement
- [x] Clean up any test artifacts (sessions, installed packages)

## Notes
Record any observations, bugs, or improvement ideas here:

1. The JavaScript execution engine seems to be using older JS syntax rules (pre-ES6)
2. Package management has inconsistencies between installation status and detection
3. Session variables are stored in a way that allows their use but doesn't show them in session info

## Testing Results Summary
- Total tests run: 19
