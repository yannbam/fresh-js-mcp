# Development Notes and Ideas

This document captures various thoughts, ideas, and research findings that don't fit elsewhere.

## Implementation Ideas

### Console Output Capture
- Consider using a proxy for console methods
- Maintain chronological order of different console outputs (log, error, warn)
- Include timestamps for detailed logging
- Color coding different output types when formatting

### Session Management Efficiency
- Consider using LRU cache for session storage
- Implement background cleanup for stale sessions
- Track session usage patterns for optimization
- Keep metadata separate from heavyweight session objects

### Error Handling Improvements
- Create custom error classes for different error types
- Include context about what caused the error
- Suggest possible fixes in error messages
- Add links to relevant documentation

### TypeScript Enhancements
- Consider caching transpiled TypeScript
- Support importing type definitions from DefinitelyTyped
- Add minimal type-checking mode for performance
- Look into incremental compilation for larger projects

### Performance Optimizations
- Investigate VM warmup strategies
- Consider resource pooling for heavy operations
- Implement selective caching of expensive operations
- Track and log performance metrics

## Research Findings

### VM2 Considerations
- VM2 is more secure than Node's native VM but still has limitations
- Some VM2 security issues have been found over time
- Stay updated with latest VM2 versions

### NPM Package Installation
- Consider using npm-pacote for direct package downloads
- Package lockfiles provide more deterministic installations
- Package installation is network and I/O intensive

### TypeScript Compiler API
- TypeScript's compiler API is powerful but complex
- Performance varies based on compilation options
- Source map generation adds overhead but improves debugging

## Interesting Edge Cases

### Circular References
- JSON serialization breaks with circular references
- Need custom handling for displaying circular structures

### Promise Handling
- Promises with no error handling can cause silent failures
- Some promises might never resolve
- Complex promise chains can be difficult to track

### Module Edge Cases
- Some modules modify global state
- ESM vs CommonJS resolution differences
- Dynamic imports create additional complexity
