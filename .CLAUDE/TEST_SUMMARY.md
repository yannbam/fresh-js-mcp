# JavaScript MCP Server Test Summary

## Overview
The JavaScript MCP server was tested to evaluate its functionality and reliability as an MCP tool provider. The testing focused on all major components including JavaScript execution, REPL sessions, package management, and TypeScript support.

## Testing Approach
Testing was conducted using the Claude Desktop as the MCP client. All tools were tested systematically according to the test plan, with results documented for each test case.

## Key Findings

### Working Features

1. **Basic Status & Server Connection**
   - js-status tool works perfectly
   - Server connects and responds reliably

2. **REPL Session Management**
   - Session creation, listing, and deletion work well
   - Variable persistence between executions functions correctly

3. **TypeScript Transpilation**
   - Successfully transpiles TypeScript code with type checking
   - Generates valid JavaScript and source maps
   - Correctly identifies type errors

### Issues Requiring Attention

1. **JavaScript Execution Engine Issues (CRITICAL)**
   - Cannot execute code with modern JavaScript syntax (const, let, etc.)
   - Top-level return and throw statements cause syntax errors
   - These problems affect both js-execute and js-executeTypeScript

2. **Package Management Inconsistencies (HIGH)**
   - Package installation reports success but findPackage fails to detect installed packages
   - This creates a disconnected experience for package management

3. **Session Variable Tracking (MEDIUM)**
   - Variables can be used in sessions but aren't reported in session info
   - Session info shows "No variables defined" even when they exist and are usable

4. **Console Output Capture (MEDIUM)**
   - Only console.log output is captured
   - console.error and console.warn are ignored

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Update JavaScript Execution Engine**
   - Modify executor.ts to support modern JavaScript syntax
   - Fix the Function constructor wrapper to allow const, let, return, and throw statements
   - Consider using a more modern JS execution environment

2. **Fix Package Management**
   - Ensure installed packages are properly tracked and discoverable
   - Fix the disconnect between installation and detection

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Enhance Session Variable Tracking**
   - Update session-manager.ts to properly expose variables in session context
   - Ensure sessionInfo shows all variables in the session

2. **Complete Console Output Capture**
   - Capture all console methods (log, error, warn, info)
   - Format them appropriately in the output

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Sandboxing Improvements**
   - Consider using a more robust sandboxing solution
   - Ensure safety while supporting modern JavaScript

2. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Provide more detailed and helpful error messages
   - Enhance stack traces to be more useful for debugging

## Test Coverage
- 19 test cases executed
- 11 passed successfully
- 6 failed
- 2 partial passes
- 2 tests skipped due to blocking issues

## Conclusion
The JavaScript MCP server has a solid foundation with good session management and TypeScript transpilation capabilities. However, the critical issues with JavaScript execution significantly limit its usefulness in its current state. The recommended fixes should be implemented before the server is deployed for production use.

These issues appear to be relatively straightforward to fix and would greatly enhance the server's functionality and user experience.
