# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach
The project follows a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and correctness:

### 1. Unit Testing
- Tests individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies for focused testing
- High coverage of core functionality
- Special focus on error handling and edge cases

### 2. Integration Testing
- Tests interactions between components
- Verifies MCP protocol compliance
- Tests end-to-end tool calls
- Validates session persistence

### 3. Manual Testing
- Test with real MCP clients (Claude)
- Verify edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance and resource usage testing

## Test Structure
- **/test/unit/**: Unit tests for individual components
- **/test/integration/**: Integration tests for system interactions
- **Jest** as the testing framework
- **ts-jest** for TypeScript support

## Key Test Areas

### Core Execution Engine
- Syntax error handling
- Runtime error handling
- Promise resolution
- Console output capture
- Memory usage
- Timeouts and long-running operations

### Session Management
- Session creation/deletion
- State persistence between calls
- Session isolation
- Cleanup of stale sessions

### File System Operations
- File reading/writing
- Directory operations
- Path resolution
- Error handling for missing files/permissions

### Package Management
- Package installation
- Version resolution
- Dependency handling
- Cache operations

### TypeScript
- Transpilation
- Type checking
- Source mapping
- Error reporting

## Coverage Goals
- Aim for >80% code coverage overall
- 100% coverage for core execution logic
- 100% coverage for error handling paths

## CI Integration
- Run tests on every pull request
- Run tests before releases
- Coverage reports
