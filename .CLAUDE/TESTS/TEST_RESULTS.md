6. **Issue**: Complex Data Structure Tests Failed
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Fix**: Fixed execution engine to handle object literals and modern syntax
   - **Verification**: Successfully created and returned complex objects

## Performance Observations

- **Tool Response Times**: Initial responses are quick (<100ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Cannot be determined from tests
- **Stability**: Significantly improved stability with JavaScript execution

## Conclusion

The JavaScript MCP server has been significantly improved with the latest fixes:

### What Works Well
- Basic server status reporting (`js-status`)
- Full JavaScript execution with modern syntax support
- Complex object creation and manipulation
- REPL session management (creation, listing, information, deletion)
- Session variable persistence when using `this.varName` pattern
- TypeScript transpilation with type checking
- Package management with consistent installation and discovery
- Complete console output capture for all methods

### What Needs Improvement
- Session variables aren't visible in session info despite being usable
- TypeScript execution has issues with returning values
- No direct support for requiring external modules

### Remaining Issues to Fix
1. Session information should properly display variables defined in the session
2. TypeScript execution should handle return values consistently
3. A module loading system would enhance functionality

Overall, the JavaScript MCP server is now much more functional and ready for most common use cases. The remaining issues are less critical and can be addressed in future updates for a fully polished experience.
