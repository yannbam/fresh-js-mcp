## Issues Discovered

1. **Issue**: JavaScript execution fails with modern syntax
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Try to use const, return, or throw keywords at the top level
   - **Expected behavior**: Execute JavaScript with modern syntax
   - **Actual behavior**: Syntax errors for common keywords

2. **Issue**: Console output capture is incomplete
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Use console.error and console.warn in executed code
   - **Expected behavior**: All console output types captured
   - **Actual behavior**: Only console.log output is captured

3. **Issue**: Session variables not visible in session info
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Define a variable in a session, then check sessionInfo
   - **Expected behavior**: Variables shown in session info
   - **Actual behavior**: Reports "No variables defined" despite variables being usable

4. **Issue**: Package management inconsistency
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Install a package and then try to find it
   - **Expected behavior**: Package should be found after installation
   - **Actual behavior**: Package installation reports success but findPackage still reports not installed

5. **Issue**: TypeScript execution failing despite successful transpilation
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Execute valid TypeScript code with js-executeTypeScript
   - **Expected behavior**: Transpiled code should execute successfully
   - **Actual behavior**: Same syntax errors as with regular JavaScript execution

6. **Issue**: Complex Data Structure Tests Failed
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Create and return object literal with js-execute
   - **Expected behavior**: Object should be created and returned
   - **Actual behavior**: Syntax errors

## Performance Observations

- **Tool Response Times**: Initial responses are quick (<100ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Cannot be determined from tests
- **Stability**: Some instability with JavaScript execution

## Conclusion

The JavaScript MCP server testing revealed a mixture of functioning and non-functioning components:

### What Works Well
- Basic server status reporting (`js-status`)
- Simple JavaScript arithmetic operations
- REPL session management (creation, listing, information, deletion)
- TypeScript transpilation with type checking

### What Needs Improvement
- JavaScript execution engine has fundamental issues with modern JavaScript syntax
- Package management has inconsistencies between installation and discovery
- Variable persistence in sessions works but isn't visible in session info
- Console output capture is incomplete

### Critical Issues to Fix
1. The JavaScript execution engine needs to be fixed to support modern syntax like `const`, `let`, and top-level `return`/`throw` statements
2. Package management needs to be fixed to correctly report installed packages
3. Session variable tracking should show all variables defined in the session

Overall, while some components are working correctly, the JavaScript execution functionality—which is central to the MCP server's purpose—has significant limitations that prevent many common use cases from working correctly. These issues should be addressed before the server is ready for production use.
