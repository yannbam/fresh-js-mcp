# Latest Conversation Summary (March 24, 2025)

## Discussion Topics
1. Initial project definition for a JavaScript MCP server
2. Defining core features and capabilities
3. Creating an optimized architecture
4. Addressing asynchronous execution challenges
5. Including NPM and TypeScript support
6. Setting up the project structure

## Key Decisions
1. **Project Scope**: Create a JavaScript MCP server that allows both one-time script execution and stateful REPL sessions.
2. **Core Features**:
   - JavaScript execution (one-time and REPL sessions)
   - Session management with state persistence
   - File system operations
   - Module importing
   - Dynamic NPM package installation
   - TypeScript transpilation
   - Comprehensive error handling
3. **Asynchronous Handling**: Auto-await promises with strict timeouts to handle async code in synchronous tool calls.
4. **Technology Choices**:
   - VM2 for JavaScript isolation
   - TypeScript compiler API for transpilation
   - MCP SDK for protocol implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the basic MCP server
2. Create the JavaScript execution engine
3. Implement session management
4. Add file system operations
5. Support NPM package management
6. Add TypeScript transpilation
